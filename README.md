# Portland-Trimet-Live-Map
Live Trimet Bus/Rail map

The server code for this application can be found in my [Portland-Trimet-Live-Map-SERVER Repo](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Portland-Trimet-Live-Map-SERVER)

Live bus/rail location for public transportation in Portland, Oregon. This project was inspired by a number of similiar applications local developers have built. I wanted to make one using the Google Maps API while still allowing users to filter bus/rail routes. 

This project interacts with my [server](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Portland-Trimet-Live-Map-SERVER). The server consumes the [TriMet API](https://developer.trimet.org/).
